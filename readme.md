This is a game / game engine I made in Global Game Jam 2016 With Python and Pygame.

Current build is a debug build and does not represent what the game is going to be once ( if ever ) finished.

Controls:
    Arrow keys  > movement
    Z           > Shoot
    C           > Place a beacon
    SpaceBar    > Activate a spell

Use beacons to draw spirit circles in order to use spells


current bugs:
    The start menu doesn't show up, press around upper center parts of the windows. There is a button there that is
    just invisible.
