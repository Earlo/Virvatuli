This is a game / game engine I made in Global Game Jam 2016 With Python and Pygame.

Current build is a debug build and does not represent what the game is going to be once ( if ever ) finished.

Controls:
    Arrow keys  > movement
    Z           > Shoot
    C           > Place a beacon
    SpaceBar    > Activate a spell

Use beacons to draw spirit circles in order to use spells




This build is mostly a personal project where I see how things work with Python multiprocessing, may replace the main branch at some point.
Most of the features ( is there any? ) work as intended now.
